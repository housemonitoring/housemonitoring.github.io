<p>Hi there Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? You may access this camera via your smart device or PC and examine out whether your camera is working if yes. If not, you might take a look at the dome camera in the evening and see if there is any red glow given off by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. If yes, then the dome camera is working.
