<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and clever thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 extra a month.

Alarm system permits require a one-time registration charge of $45. There is no annual renewal charge and the authorization remains in place as long as the alarm is in use at the very same address.

However there's a plus side: Once you get in the contract, Protect America offers the vital home security equipment free of charge without extra upfront expenses. You're only responsible for the monthly monitoring cost and any optional upgrades. There's also a cost match warranty.</p>
