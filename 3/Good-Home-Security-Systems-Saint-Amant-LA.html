If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly.
