<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
