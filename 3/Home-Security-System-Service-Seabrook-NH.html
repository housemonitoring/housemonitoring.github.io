<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Simply put, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to manage your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you instant signals.
