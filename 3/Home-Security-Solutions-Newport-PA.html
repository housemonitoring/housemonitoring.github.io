That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with options for more via subscription. Although it does not have the best operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
