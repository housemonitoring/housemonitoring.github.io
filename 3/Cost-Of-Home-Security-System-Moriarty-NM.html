<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Fantastic clearness. I wanted to set up viewing on my cell phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the initial fee.
