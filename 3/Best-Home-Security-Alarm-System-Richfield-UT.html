<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
