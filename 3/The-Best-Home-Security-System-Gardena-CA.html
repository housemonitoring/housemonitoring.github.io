<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Basically, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and different detectors all connected to a main control board by means of radio signals.
