Numerous other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
