<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
