<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
