DIY security systems are perfect for pretty much any living scenario, including rental houses and apartments. Much of the various devices, such as the contact and motion sensing units, included strong two-sided adhesive, so you won't need to drill into walls (and risk losing your security deposit).

We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
