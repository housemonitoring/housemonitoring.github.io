<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurance provider provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use a number of "totally free" false alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>So what happens if something activates your alarm but you remain in a conference with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service suggests you do not get signaled up until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound may frighten potential burglars-- if you're fortunate. But the cops won't come till you personally call them.</p>
<p>When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring professionals are standing by all set to dispatch emergency situation services in case an alarm is set off.

Since of the extra layer of security that's in location must you be away from home when something takes place, we suggest having your home professionally monitored. Without expert monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, generally with a mobile app and activity alerts.</p>
