"As soon as the crime and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the general downward trend in crimes and offences," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British government).</p>
