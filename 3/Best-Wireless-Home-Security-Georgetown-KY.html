Video plays a crucial role in the prosecution of lawbreakers. Law enforcement workplaces throughout the nation will tell you that they LIKE video. A home surveillance system makes it easy to record what occurred and lets you review events at your convenience. 4-6 False alarms: $50. You require alarm-compatible smoke detectors if you want to catch a fire in the early phases. They'll call the fire department right away if you hook up to a monitoring service. If you do not use a monitoring service, the system can call, text or email you and a list of next-door neighbors and pals.</p>
