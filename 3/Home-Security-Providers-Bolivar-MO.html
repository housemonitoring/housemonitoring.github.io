<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use several "free" false alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
