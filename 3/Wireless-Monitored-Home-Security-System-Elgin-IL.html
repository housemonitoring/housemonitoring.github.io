<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring.
