The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of day, usage and night images have actually always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.
