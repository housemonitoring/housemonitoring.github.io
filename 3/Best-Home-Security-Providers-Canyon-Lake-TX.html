<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
