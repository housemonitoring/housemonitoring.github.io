<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.
