<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
