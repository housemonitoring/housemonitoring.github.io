<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
