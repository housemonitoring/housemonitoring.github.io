Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
