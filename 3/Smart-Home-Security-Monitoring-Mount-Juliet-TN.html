<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations.

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work.
