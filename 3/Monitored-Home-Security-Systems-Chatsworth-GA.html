<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
