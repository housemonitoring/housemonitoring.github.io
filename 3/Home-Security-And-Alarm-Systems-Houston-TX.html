<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
