<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing convenience, comfort and complete satisfaction to every client and are committed to satisfying our client's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
