<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires.
