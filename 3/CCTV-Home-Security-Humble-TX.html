Alarm companies should provide property owners with instructions that supply sufficient info to run and keep the alarm system.

Remember, once a call is received by the Police Dispatcher of an activated alarm, we are needed to react. From the house app, you can see your camera's live feed, control features like geofencing, and you can switch between abode's three modes: home, standby, and away.

We recommend cellular systems since they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available.
