<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
