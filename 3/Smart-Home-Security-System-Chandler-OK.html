<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
