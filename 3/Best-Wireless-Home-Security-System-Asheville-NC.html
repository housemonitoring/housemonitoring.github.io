That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with choices for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cord and plug.
