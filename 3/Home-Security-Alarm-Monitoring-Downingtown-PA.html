<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable.

<p>As the name suggests, this alarm is a starter kit". So it's basically anticipated that it will not have actually extended customizability or a large range of functions. Nevertheless, I am still disappointed that they haven't included a minimum of a basic camera with this set.

<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
