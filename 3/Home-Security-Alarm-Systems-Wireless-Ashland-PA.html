<p>Mix of Guy and Maker: Individuals ought to be out on the streets and work-places trying to prevent criminal activity or losses. CCTV cameras are just a less reliable alternative to having cops stroll the streets or security workers on patrolling and physical surveillance.

The video footage works as an enhance to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
