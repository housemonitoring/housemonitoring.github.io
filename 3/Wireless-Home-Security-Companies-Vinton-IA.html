In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.

Outdoor cameras ought to be weather resistant and sometimes, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most long lasting.

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
