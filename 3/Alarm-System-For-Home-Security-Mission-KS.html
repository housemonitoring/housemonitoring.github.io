<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
