<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. Since it comes with multiple door and window sensing units for complete protection, we advise the eight-piece package. We also suggest including a doorbell video camera at some point.
