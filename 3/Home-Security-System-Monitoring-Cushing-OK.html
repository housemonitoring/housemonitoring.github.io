<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Calling in a service technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let a professional handle the task and do not mind spending the money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
