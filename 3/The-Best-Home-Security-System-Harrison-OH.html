You can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort if you're using a home automation center to manage things like lighting and thermostats. At the same time, if you do not have a home automation center, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that features its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize standard pre-drilled holes and are fairly easy to install.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced clever home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
