We value that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for watching on your kids and pets, however if you're worried about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing a second of the action.

Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>Last, we also consider just how much it costs to see, share and conserve taped video. While some cameras still let you view a couple of days of tape-recorded video, the trend has actually been to only let you enjoy live video from your camera unless you register for a membership. That indicates you can't look back a couple of hours or days to see who was walking through your lawn.
