<p>When the alarm company representative has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a written proposal and a copy of the contract you will need to sign.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
