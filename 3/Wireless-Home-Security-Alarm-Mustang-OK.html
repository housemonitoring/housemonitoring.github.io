If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
