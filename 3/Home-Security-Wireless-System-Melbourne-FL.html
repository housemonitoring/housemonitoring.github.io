<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
