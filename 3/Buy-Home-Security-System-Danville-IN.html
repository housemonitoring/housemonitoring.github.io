<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both animals and people.

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
