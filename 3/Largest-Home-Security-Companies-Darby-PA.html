They can be set up on the exterior or interior of a building to monitor sensitive areas such as entrances, parking area, money spaces, or secure locations of a building.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
