It has since been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
