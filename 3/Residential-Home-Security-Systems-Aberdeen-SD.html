<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible offenders are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they believe they are being seen or have a higher threat of being captured. This is likewise known as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
