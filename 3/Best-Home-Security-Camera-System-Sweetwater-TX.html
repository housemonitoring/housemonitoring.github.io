<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors protect your security system against transient surges that can enter through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones.

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both humans and animals.

Fortunately, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your house increases to a harmful level.

<p>Although 1080p is usually the basic resolution for cameras we have actually tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensors.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not need a new keypad. Using numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor informs the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch right away. This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
