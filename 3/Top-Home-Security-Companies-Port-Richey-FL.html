<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, typically through 110VAC power.</p>

Standard elements in most home security packages include a master control board, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor gadget. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have in-home alarms.</p>

<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches use only to NVR systems, however they cut out other parts that would be essential for a DVR system, like extra power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to link cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you connect a PoE switch to your network, you've got a source of power and a means of transmitting data to your NVR all in one plan. The biggest consideration when selecting which kind of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next consideration is how likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp image up to 32 feet.

Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
