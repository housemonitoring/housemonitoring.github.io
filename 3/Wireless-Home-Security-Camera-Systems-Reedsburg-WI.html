Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering numerous decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet economical systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
