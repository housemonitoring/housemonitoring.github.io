Figure 1-1 illustrates an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select areas of coverage. The very first installation was created and developed for the separate parking center. This application consisted of several set position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked directly to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic device for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cables.

<p>The mobile phone app has 3 moduses operandi-- Standby, Home, and Away. You hear a tiny chirping sound whenever the entry sensors get triggered when you position the device on Standby mode.

These are all relatively intelligent modes, but they can not be changed. You can't change the level of sensitivity of the sensors or schedule them. This also leaves you vulnerable to incorrect alarms, particularly if you have small kids or family pets in your house. Some individuals prefer the lack of customizability due to the fact that it makes the entire device incredibly simple to use. However it can also be a significant obstacle for some.</p>
