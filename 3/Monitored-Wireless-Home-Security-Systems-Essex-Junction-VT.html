<p>Residence also provides a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensing unit and one motion detector.

Be absolutely sure you can manage it if you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
