However, alarms required by insurer need to abide by the European Requirement EN 50131 and must be installed by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer. All of the wise alarms on the marketplace presently do not comply with the European Requirement, and as they're created to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurer. By integrating LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the market. Throughout our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and utilize-- but not quite as easy as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
