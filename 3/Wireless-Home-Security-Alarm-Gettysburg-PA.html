Initially, standard security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, typically a home alarm company. The client paid regular monthly costs.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are often poor night vision entertainers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a light to light up the location listed below it.

This means they generally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering people and items to appear blown out" and with no detail. So much for trying to identify the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, typically are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and in full information. If a camera can not record and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has restricted effectiveness.</p>

It provides you a peek into what's going on at home when you include a security camera to your home security system. If something triggers your alarm, you can examine your cameras to see what set it off. Everyday, cameras let you appear to state hi to the kids after school or inspect that your packages are still on the patio.</p>
