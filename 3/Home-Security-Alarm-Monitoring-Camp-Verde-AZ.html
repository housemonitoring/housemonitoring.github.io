Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
