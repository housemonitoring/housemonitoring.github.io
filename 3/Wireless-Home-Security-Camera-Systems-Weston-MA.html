<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to save and for how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

Rules are required to develop a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other government firms, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and enforced; and what punishments would apply to lawbreakers.</p>
