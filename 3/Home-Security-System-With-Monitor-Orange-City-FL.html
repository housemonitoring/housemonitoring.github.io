<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
