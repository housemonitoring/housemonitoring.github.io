<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
