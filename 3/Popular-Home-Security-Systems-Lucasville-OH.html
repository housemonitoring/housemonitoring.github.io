<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are frequently bad night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to illuminate the location below it. Unfortunately, the night vision illuminators that include customer cameras are developed for brief range just and are of a fixed brightness. This means they typically over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing items and people to appear blown out" and with no detail. A lot for trying to determine the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and in full detail.

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
