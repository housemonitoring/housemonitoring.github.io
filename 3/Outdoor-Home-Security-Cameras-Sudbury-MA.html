We tried each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
