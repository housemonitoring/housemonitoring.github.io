Some individuals may wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in total control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>

Many insurance companies use discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments use a number of "complimentary" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
