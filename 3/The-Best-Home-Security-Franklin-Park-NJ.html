With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch right away.
