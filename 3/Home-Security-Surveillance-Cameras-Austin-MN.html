<p>The Samsung SmartThings Home Monitoring Set does not included a water leak sensing unit or an arrival sensor, however you can get them individually. The truth that you can buy additional sensors suggests that you can include sensing units in various spaces around your house at a cheap price so you can monitor different zones separately. Standard elements in many home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor device. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have in-home alarms.</p>

It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
