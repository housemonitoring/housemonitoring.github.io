<p>So what occurs if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a conference with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you don't get informed until the next day?

A great deal of wise cameras can be configured to do things like this, but couple of make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
