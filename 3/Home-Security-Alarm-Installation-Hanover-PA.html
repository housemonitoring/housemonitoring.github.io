<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not suggest it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work.
