The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature differences. Due to the fact that things are seldom exactly the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>
