<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
