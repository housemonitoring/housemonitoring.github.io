<p>DISCLAIMER: We bought the iSmart camera, Piper, SimpliSafe, Scout, Ring Alarm, Nest Secure, and whatever SmartThings on our own, but the iSmartAlarm system, home system, and Arlo cameras were given to us for testing. This did not affect our viewpoint, but we believed you should know. As you weigh your security alternatives, make sure you're not neglecting the security basics.

<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another factor to read your existing alarm arrangement carefully. ADT for instance uses complimentary" home security systems when you register for their multiyear alarm monitoring plan. Certainly nothing is free. In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensor. Anything added additional you would own but if you do not renew their high priced plan they'll remove their" equipment leaving you without any working alarm system. Just another tricky technique to maintain extremely profitable accounts.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and taking some time off from work. Hiring a service technician costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional handle the task and do not mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
