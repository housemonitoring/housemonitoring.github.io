The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
