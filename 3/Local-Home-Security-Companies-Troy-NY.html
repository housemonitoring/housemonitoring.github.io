The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
