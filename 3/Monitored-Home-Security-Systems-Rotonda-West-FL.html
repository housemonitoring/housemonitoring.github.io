Despite the fact that it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
