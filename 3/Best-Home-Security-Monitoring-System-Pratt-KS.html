<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
