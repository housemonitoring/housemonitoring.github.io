To be sure, opt for a company that offers you full access to your programming and code functions and uses non-proprietary components.</p>

That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape-record again, which means you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any spaces in between.
