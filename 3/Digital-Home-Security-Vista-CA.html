With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
