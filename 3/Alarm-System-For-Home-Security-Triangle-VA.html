<p>During the night, though it does not have the complete IR LED selection of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Simply a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a few huge names providing expensive, rigid plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term agreements.

Given that, its advantages - preventing at a lot of a couple of street criminal offenses, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
