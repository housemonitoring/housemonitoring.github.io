<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
