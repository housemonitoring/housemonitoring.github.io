We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
