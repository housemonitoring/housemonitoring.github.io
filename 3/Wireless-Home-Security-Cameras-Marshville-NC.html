Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
