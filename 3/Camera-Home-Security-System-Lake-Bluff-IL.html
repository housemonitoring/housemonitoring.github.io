<h3>Intrusion Alarm System Lake Bluff IL 60044</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
