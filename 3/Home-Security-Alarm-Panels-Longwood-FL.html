<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
