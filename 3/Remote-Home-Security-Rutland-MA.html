<p>Houston homeowners have options when it concerns home security systems. You can choose a nationally acknowledged brand or opt for a local company.

Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free fixture. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a lot of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren. Likewise like the camera, it requires an Arlo Smart subscription to store video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

The camera video footage offers additional leads in an examination and aids in securing witness cooperation. The video footage functions as an enhance to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness evidence in the courtroom.</p>
