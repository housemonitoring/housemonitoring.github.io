<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, assurance and complete satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to satisfying our consumer's needs with integrity, honesty, interest and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>Telephone lines over the previous several years, had actually been extensively utilized to link alarm systems to the main station for signal transmission and the wrongdoers understand it! Now, burglars regularly cut the telephone lines to services and homes, even whole neighborhoods, prior to breaking in. Plus, the telephone system itself is prone to issues caused by weather, mishaps, equipment failures and natural catastrophes. Not to point out the recent changes in phone services, like (VOIP) Voice over internet procedure which are not a trusted type of communication for alarm or any information transmission, most of the time preventing alarm signals from going through to the main station. Phone networks were not initially developed with security in mind. Any of these issues could avoid your essential alarm messages from reaching the main station, police, fire, and emergency response personnel.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in total control of the equipment you use, in addition to how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
