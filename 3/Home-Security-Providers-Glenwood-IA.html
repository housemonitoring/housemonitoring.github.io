<p>We tried to find Do It Yourself systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply heavily discounted or totally free hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some people might wish to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in total control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
