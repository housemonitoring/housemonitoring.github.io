<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
