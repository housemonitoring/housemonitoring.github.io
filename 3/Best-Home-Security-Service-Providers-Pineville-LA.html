IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.
