<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months.

<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and features a practical mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the price, and best of all, it includes complimentary cloud storage (up to 2 hours in total).

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Consumer Reports laboratory. You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must be enough to frighten burglars most of the times. Security cameras are an excellent start to protecting your home.

Though sometimes totally free, these cloud plans usually need a regular monthly subscription, however are worth it both for their convenience and if you desire a surveillance record during a trip or other prolonged time far from home.</p>
