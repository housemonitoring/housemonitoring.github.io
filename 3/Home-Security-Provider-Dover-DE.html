In lower Manhattan, for example, the police are planning to establish a central surveillance center where officers can see countless camera around the downtown - and police-operated cameras have proliferated in many other cities throughout America in simply the past a number of years.</p>
<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically redirect the field of vision without remounting the security camera each time.
