These are all relatively smart modes, but they can not be altered. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or arrange them. This also leaves you susceptible to incorrect alarms, especially if you have small kids or family pets in your home. Some people choose the lack of customizability since it makes the whole gadget very easy to utilize. However it can also be a major obstacle for some.</p>
