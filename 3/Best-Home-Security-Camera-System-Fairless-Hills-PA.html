<h3>Best Rated Home Security Systems in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras take advantage of not requiring integrated infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional delicate imaging chips.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
