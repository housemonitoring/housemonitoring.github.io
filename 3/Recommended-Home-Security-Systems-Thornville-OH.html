<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home.
