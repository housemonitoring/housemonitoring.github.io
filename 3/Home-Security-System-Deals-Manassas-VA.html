Some wireless systems are DIY, meaning that you can set up the system without stressing over working with a professional alarm installation team.

<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
