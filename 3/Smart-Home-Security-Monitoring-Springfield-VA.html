<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service.
