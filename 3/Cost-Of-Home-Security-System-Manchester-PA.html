<p>You might spend a similar amount for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring.

We recommend cellular systems because they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
