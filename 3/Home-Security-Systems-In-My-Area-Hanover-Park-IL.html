<p>Telephone lines over the previous a number of decades, had been widely utilized to link alarm to the central station for signal transmission and the bad guys understand it! Now, burglars regularly cut the telephone lines to organisations and homes, even whole areas, prior to breaking in. Plus, the telephone system itself is prone to problems caused by weather, mishaps, equipment failures and natural catastrophes. Not to mention the current changes in phone services, like (VOIP) Voice over internet protocol which are not a dependable type of interaction for alarm systems or any information transmission, the majority of the time avoiding alarm signals from going through to the main station. Phone networks were not initially created with security in mind.

<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
