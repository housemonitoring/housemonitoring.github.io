Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of robbery protection; mix systems supply both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems might likewise be integrated with closed-circuit tv surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically tape-record the activities of burglars, and might interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.
