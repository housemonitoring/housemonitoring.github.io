<p>A clever lock is generally part of a robust smart home security setup, but you don't have to invest in a full-blown system to use one. If you're utilizing a home automation hub to control things like lighting and thermostats, you can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort. At the same time, if you don't have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks use basic pre-drilled holes and are fairly easy to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
<p>Smart device combination: If you have a home filled with clever devices, consider trying to find a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can connect them. Assistance for an automation service such as IFTTT or Stringify is likewise beneficial. This enables the camera or monitor to respond to different scenarios, such as taking a photo when your Nest Protect discovers smoke, or informing your Philips Color smart bulb to turn on when unexpected sounds are spotted.</p>
<p>All of the self-installed systems I checked can operate without a monitoring plan, however then they are restricted to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and sometimes, pushing a notification to your phone and lack the capability to instantly dispatch authorities or emergency situation personnel. Considering that phone batteries pass away and cellular service varies depending upon where you are, a push alert is usually a bad method of triaging when your home security system has been tripped.</p>
