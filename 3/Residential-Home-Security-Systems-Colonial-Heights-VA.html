<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
