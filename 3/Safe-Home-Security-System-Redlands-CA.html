<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
