<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>Like any invasive technology, the advantages of deploying public video cameras need to be balanced versus the expenses and dangers. This technology (a) has the possible change the core experience of heading out in public in America because of its chilling effect on citizens, (b) carries very genuine dangers of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably safeguard us versus terrorism. Given that, its advantages - preventing at most a few street criminal offenses, and most likely none - are disproportionately small.</p>
