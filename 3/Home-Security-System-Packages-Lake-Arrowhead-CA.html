<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps during crucial security events. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise among our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on family and family pets-- or stray felines slipping around your lawn.</p>
