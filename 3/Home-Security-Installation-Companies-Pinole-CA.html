<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
