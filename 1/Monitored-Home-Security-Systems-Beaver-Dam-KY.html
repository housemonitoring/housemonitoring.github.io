It also comes with 2 days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 discussed that uses a combination of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind when deciding.</p>
