<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". Wish to add a flood sensor? A smart door lock? Your system can function as a center for as much as 119 wise home devices, and can be managed by means of Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and supplies power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally considered a more secure way to transfer data.</p>
