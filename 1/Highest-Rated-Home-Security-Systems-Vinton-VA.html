Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
