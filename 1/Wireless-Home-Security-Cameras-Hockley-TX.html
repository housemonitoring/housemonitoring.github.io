This will scare off some trespassers, but typically does not do much beyond that. These usually aren't part of a monitoring system either - they act on their own.

I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB.
