<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for example, a top-level cops official in Washington, DC was caught using cops databases to collect info on patrons of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he tried to blackmail customers who were wed. Picture what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

<p>Even though 1080p is usually the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is taping.
