<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Lots of insurer offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use numerous "totally free" false alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
