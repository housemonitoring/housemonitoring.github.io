<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas.
