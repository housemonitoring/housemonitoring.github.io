In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
