Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of robbery protection; mix systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.

<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam combines 2 important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight.

Guidelines are required to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be validated and implemented; and what penalties would apply to violators.</p>
