<h2>Rechargeable Wireless Security Camera Ellenton</h2>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
