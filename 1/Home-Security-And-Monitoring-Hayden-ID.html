<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it enables you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly personalized. Inside the app, you can even manage email subscriptions, SMS notifies, or the in-app alerts.</p>

Landline systems utilize standard phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
<p>Motion detectors are often stationed at entry walls and in large spaces, and they are easy to establish. When they identify movement, the alarm is set off and other security gadgets (such as a camera) might be activated.
