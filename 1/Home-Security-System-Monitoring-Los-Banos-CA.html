If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to correctly discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces during important security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest among our top picks, however the Arlo is fantastic for checking in on family and pets-- or roaming cats sliding around your yard.</p>
