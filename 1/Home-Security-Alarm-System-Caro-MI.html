Likewise, the app stays tough to browse, though they are moving users to a newer app called 'SmartThings Connect' which has potential. Similar to Vizzini's overuse of unthinkable" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" pretty freely. We get it. It's a buzzword that offers the benefit of equipment without any strings connected. But wireless" can really suggest a few various things for a home security system, and it can get complicated.</p>

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well.
