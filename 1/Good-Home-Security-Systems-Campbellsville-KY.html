Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
