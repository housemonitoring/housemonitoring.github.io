<h3>The Best House Alarm Systems in Interlachen FL</h3>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
