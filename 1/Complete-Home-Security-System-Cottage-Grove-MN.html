In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have actually not reduced criminal activity. "As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the general down trend in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in certain categories but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
