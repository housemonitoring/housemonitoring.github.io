<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
