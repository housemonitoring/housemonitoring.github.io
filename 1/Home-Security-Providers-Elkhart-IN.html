<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
