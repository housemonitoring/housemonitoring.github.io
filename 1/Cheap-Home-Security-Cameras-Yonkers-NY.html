<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
