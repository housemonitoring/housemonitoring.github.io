When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers.
