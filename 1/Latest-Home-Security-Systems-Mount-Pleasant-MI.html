<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera discovers motion or noise, you can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation. This series of events likewise works in reverse. For instance, if somebody opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape-record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which occurs to be the loudest of the 3 sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro discovers a noise, you can have your lights set to switch on.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve.
