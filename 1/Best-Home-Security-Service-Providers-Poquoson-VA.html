The South American nation bought an entire national video surveillance system from China, including 4,300 cameras. The Nest Secure alarm finishes the circle. Its entry sensors likewise work as motion sensors and come with thoughtful features like Quiet Open (which lets you open a single door without triggering the entire alarm) and Pathlight (where a night light turns on when you walk by).</p>

Amazon's face recognition tool, Rekognition, is amongst the real-time video face recognition products currently being piloted by cops departments around the country, in addition to the FBI.

<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurance companies offer discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, since they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
