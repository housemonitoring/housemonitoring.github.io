The videos your camera records probably won't be minimized the camera itself. The majority of home security cameras utilize cloud services to keep and provide remote access to video footage Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you wish to review footage, but this is an uncommon function. Still, if technology has actually made us susceptible, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have been pushing tough to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera space.
