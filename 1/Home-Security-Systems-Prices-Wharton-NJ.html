<p>For the majority of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, linking your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be a vital component. While a growing number of wireless security cameras are becoming popular, particularly for home use, wired security cameras still rule supreme for more long-term and demanding security use. Some people would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate rather of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Professionally monitored security systems require a month-to-month monitoring cost that can vary from ($ 20 to $60) monthly. When identifying how much a burglar alarm costs consumers need to recognize that if they include more functions, the price will increase.</p>

Keep in mind that the more functions and extras you contribute to your system, the bigger the price tag. Some top-tier packages cost upward of $60 each month. That's still substantial, but it's a lot less than the typical loss of a break-in.
