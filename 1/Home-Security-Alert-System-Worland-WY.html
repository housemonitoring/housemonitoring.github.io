<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we loved it as a family pet web cam ).

We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
