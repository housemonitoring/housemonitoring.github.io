<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
