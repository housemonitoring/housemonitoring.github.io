Power just recently ranked Brinks # 1 in consumer fulfillment. You can find out more about specific choices and features that are available with the new Brinks in the following review.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is really easy to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it enables you to manage almost every element of the security system remotely, and it's highly personalized.
