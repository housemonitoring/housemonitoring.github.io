<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful opponent, because the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transmitted. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive attacker to record these codes and use various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>
