<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
