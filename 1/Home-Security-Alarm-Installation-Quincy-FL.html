<p>A societal consensus about how cameras should be utilized is essential, however in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Modification to the US Constitution provides some protection against video searches conducted by the cops, there are currently no general, lawfully enforceable guidelines to limit personal privacy invasions and secure against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are required to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and implemented; and what punishments would use to lawbreakers.</p>
