<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
