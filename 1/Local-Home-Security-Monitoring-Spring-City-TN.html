<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system versus transient rises that can go into through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not just about security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital solutions and development at Amica, suggests sensors that focus on things you wouldn't otherwise see, like leak sensors or freeze sensing units. Given benefits like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and securing your home, it may be the right time to upgrade your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't.

<p>Frontpoint provides 5 packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan but ended up discontented with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notice while on vacation, she had no way of determining whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her feline had handled to trip the sensor. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.

Alder doesn't promote pricing for its security systems online, and since each client's individual system might vary, the cost may differ too.
