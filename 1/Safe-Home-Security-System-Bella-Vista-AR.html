I like the mobility and low cost of Ring and SimpliSafe, but sounds like ADT is still the very best option regardless of the higher cost. I guess when compared to the cost of my house, it's a quite cheap price to pay to keep it safe and protected.</p>

The Angee is short on features and huge on running costs. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has poor daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often showed green and pink lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered during the night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>
<p>With Frontpoint, Vivint, and Ring, you can get indoor, outdoor, and video doorbell security cameras. Other companies, like SimpliSafe and ADT, also use some kind of camera. We like that several of these brand names will expertly monitor your cameras for you.

Similar to any security system, the more equipment you include, the pricier it gets. And that cost jumps a lot when you include smart cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every wise camera Blue deals is $200.</p>
