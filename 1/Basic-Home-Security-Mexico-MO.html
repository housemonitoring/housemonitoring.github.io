<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensing units work well.

<p>What many individuals do not understand is that there is another class of security camera that is directly readily available to the public, though not found in the big box and discount store.

<p>Many security cameras can be utilized both inside and outdoors. They typically have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and sometimes, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most long lasting. Since their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
