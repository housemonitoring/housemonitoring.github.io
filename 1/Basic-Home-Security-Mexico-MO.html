<p>Many security cameras can be utilized both inside and outdoors. They typically have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and sometimes, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most long lasting.
