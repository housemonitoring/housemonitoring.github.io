As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
