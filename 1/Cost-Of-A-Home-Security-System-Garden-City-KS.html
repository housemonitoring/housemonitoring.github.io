<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, but the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
