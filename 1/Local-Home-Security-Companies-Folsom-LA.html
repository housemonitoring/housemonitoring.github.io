<h3>Surveillance Camera in Folsom LA</h3>

The handsome shiny black cube, magnetically affixed to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a lovely rose-gold but you can likewise get it in silver) strikes the best balance in between attractive and subtle adequate to not accentuate itself.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
