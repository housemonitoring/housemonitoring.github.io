<p>Everyone we handled at NSS were extremely useful and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we desired, and they carried out with professionalism and proficiency. I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, specifically during the night when weather conditions really mess with the night vision.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that allows more light to enter the camera's sensor.

To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital sound decrease Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensing unit.</p>
