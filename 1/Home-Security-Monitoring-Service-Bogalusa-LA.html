<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors guard your security system against short-term surges that can get in through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not just about security from theft, either.

Offered advantages like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and securing your home, it may be the right time to update your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. However while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously restricts your choices for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks. If you already have a security device from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>The Arlo Q is compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT (If This Then That), SmartThings, and Wink. And if the included seven days of free storage isn't enough, an Arlo Smart membership includes one month of tape-recording for one camera, person detection, and motion zones for $3 per month.

Wyze's recently launched Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not advise that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
