This is likewise known as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing rewards from crime commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
