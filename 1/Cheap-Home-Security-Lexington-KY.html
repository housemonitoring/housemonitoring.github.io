<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
