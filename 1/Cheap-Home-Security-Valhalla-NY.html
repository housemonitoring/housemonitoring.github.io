<p>It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have individuals notifies that are on the company's indoor camera, given that those could actually reduce alerts of bugs and vehicle lights. Audio was also choppy, and the operating temperature level of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit won't work for chillier climates. Yale is synonymous with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a big turn-off for would-be burglars. In the past you 'd require deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and after that monitored for an additional cost) however the Smart Living range is DIY, wireless and app-controlled.</p>

<p>A societal consensus about how cameras should be utilized is necessary, however in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution offers some protection against video searches conducted by the authorities, there are currently no basic, legally enforceable rules to restrict personal privacy invasions and protect versus abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and how long are they maintained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and implemented; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>
