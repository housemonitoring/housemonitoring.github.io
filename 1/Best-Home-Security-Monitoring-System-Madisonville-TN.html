<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) occurs when a hacker has the ability to eavesdrop on network traffic and recognize the MAC address of a computer with network privileges The majority of wireless systems allow some kind of MAC filtering to allow just authorized computer systems with specific MAC IDs to access and use the network. Nevertheless, programs exist that have network smelling" capabilities.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
