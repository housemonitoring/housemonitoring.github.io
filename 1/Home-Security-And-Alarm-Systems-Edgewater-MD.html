<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set quantity of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement.
