<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
