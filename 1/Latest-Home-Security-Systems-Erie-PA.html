<p>Arlo claims that you need to have the ability to get four to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
