<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
