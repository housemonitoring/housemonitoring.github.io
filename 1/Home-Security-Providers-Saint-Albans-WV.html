<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your kids and animals, but if you're concerned about security, you do not wish to run the risk of missing a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with options for more by means of subscription. Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cord and plug.
