<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
