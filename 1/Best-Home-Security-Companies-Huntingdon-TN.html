<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Many wireless home security systems are DIY and simple to connect using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have an expert install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation costs. And when you're ready to move, merely evacuate your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or arranging a service technician. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during rush hour. After the tragic attacks, police examined CCTV camera footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, bring backpacks packed with explosives. The terrorists were recorded on several CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither observed nor intercepted before they had the ability to perform the attacks.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras can be displayed freely or kept discreet. If displayed openly, particularly when accompanied by a warning sign, they can offer an active deterrent to criminal offense. They are a more subtle method of tape-recording the environment if they are hidden. D. An alarm user will keep at each alarm system website, a set of written operating guidelines for each alarm system. (Ord. 2002-28 § 1, 2002). The downside to monitored systems is the cost.
