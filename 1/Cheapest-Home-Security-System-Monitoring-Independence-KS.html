Particularly for a Do It Yourself install system, having the capability to pick up the phone and get a security consultant on the line quickly to help you get setup or fix an issue, is crucial.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
