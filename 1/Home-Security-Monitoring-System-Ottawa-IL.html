Conditions such as outdoor or indoor place and the existence or absence of light will play a huge function in deciding which camera is best suited for the job at hand. Several other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and family pets, but if you're concerned about security, you do not wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with options for more by means of membership. Despite the fact that it does not have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug.
