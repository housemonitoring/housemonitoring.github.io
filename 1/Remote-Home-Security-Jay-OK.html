(You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
