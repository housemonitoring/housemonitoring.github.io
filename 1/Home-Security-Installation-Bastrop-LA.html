In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is set off whenever the entry sensing units are triggered. Finally, in Away mode, both the motion sensors and entry sensors are active. These are all relatively smart modes, but they can not be altered. You can't change the sensitivity of the sensing units or arrange them. This also leaves you susceptible to incorrect alarms, especially if you have small kids or pets in your home. Some people prefer the lack of customizability since it makes the entire device extremely easy to utilize. But it can likewise be a major hindrance for some.</p>
