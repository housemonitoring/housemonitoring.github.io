<p>Arlo claims that you ought to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
