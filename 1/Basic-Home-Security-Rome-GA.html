<p>Easy alarm installation. Among the most frustrating parts of a home security system is the alarm installation.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
