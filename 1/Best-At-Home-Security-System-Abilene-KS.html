<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensors work well.

Employing a professional costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert handle the task and don't mind investing the additional money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
