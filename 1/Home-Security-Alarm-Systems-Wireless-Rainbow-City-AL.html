<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
