You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself."

They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings went through extended surveillance.</p>
