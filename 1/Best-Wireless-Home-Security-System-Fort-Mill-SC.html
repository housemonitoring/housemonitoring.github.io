The very first task is the alert of a siren, this permits everyone in your community consisting of the property owners or business owners to understand that an intruder has been spotted. The 2nd task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights however the most typical alarm system and a few of the more advanced ones do.
