Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
