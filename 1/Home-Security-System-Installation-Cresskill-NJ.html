<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
