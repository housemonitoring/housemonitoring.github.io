Although you will not have an expert install your security equipment, you'll save money from installation costs.

In the London train battles in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during rush hour.

The terrorists were recorded on several CCTV cameras, but regrettably they were neither noticed nor obstructed before they had the ability to carry out the attacks.</p>

The exact same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
