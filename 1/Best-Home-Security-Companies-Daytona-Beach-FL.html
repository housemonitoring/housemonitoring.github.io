Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often utilize battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have less costly start-up costs, but may stop working if the batteries are not preserved. Depending on distance and construction materials, several wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be relocated to a new home easily, an advantage for those who lease or who move frequently. The more crucial wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system secures versus a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of a web provider. This complete wireless setup is frequently described as 100% wireless.</p>
