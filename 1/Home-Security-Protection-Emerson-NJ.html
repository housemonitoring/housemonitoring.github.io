<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
