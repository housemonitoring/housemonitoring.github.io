We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

We advise having your home professionally monitored due to the fact that of the extra layer of security that's in location needs to you be far from home when something occurs. Without expert monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, normally with a mobile app and activity notices.</p>
