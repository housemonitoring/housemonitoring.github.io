With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
