<h3>Best At Home Security System in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>But for everybody who enjoys ADT, it looks like there's someone who's had an awful experience.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We believe that's expensive.</p>

Even though it does not have the best operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug.
