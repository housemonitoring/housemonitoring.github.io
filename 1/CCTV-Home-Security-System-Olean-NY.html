Vivint isn't understood for low prices-- the equipment is a few of the most expensive on our list-- but the brand recently added a base plan that's more affordable than those of most competitors. In reality, at $29.99 a month, Vivint's base plan is a competitive method to get monitored security with mobile access.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
