Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free fixture. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling). It likewise has much of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, consisting of 2K recording, two-way audio, and an integrated siren. Likewise like the camera, it needs an Arlo Smart membership to store video recordings.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera discovers motion or noise, you can set off a video or a SmartThings automation.
