Both supply comparable offerings, but if you think there's a chance you might leave the Houston location in the future, you might be better off partnering with a nationwide brand name that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free fixture. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling). It likewise has much of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, consisting of 2K recording, two-way audio, and an integrated siren. Likewise like the camera, it needs an Arlo Smart membership to store video recordings.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera discovers motion or noise, you can set off a video or a SmartThings automation. This sequence of occasions likewise works in reverse.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though.
