<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should supply at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage).
