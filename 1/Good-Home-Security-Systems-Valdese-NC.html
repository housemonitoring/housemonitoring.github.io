<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
<p>The primary distinctions in between the two systems are wires and prices. The wires are apparent because it's in the title of the two systems.

Wireless systems count on batteries instead of wires. So, you will need to replace and charge the batteries, but the system will not connect you to your home.</p>
