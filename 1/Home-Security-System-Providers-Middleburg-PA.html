<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
