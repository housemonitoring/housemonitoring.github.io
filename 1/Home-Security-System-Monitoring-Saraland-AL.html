When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
