Security through SimpliSafe has everything you want but at a fraction of the rate. SimpliSafe does not use home automation, but for any other feature or equipment you might want with your system, chances are good that SimpliSafe has it. You can get intruder protection, environmental protection, and video feed. Your system will still protect your home in case of a power failure that lasts for days.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring.
