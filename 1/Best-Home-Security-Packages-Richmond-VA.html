The very first job is the alert of a siren, this allows for everyone in your area consisting of the homeowners or business owners to know that an intruder has actually been detected. The 2nd task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all alarm systems have flashing outdoor lights however the most common alarm system and some of the advanced ones do.
