The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
