<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole household will enjoy. It's a neat technique, and one that works quite well, however only as soon as you've configured the rest of the settings. I've got a huge pet dog, so needed to specify the locations for the camera to discover i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the dog will be walking. After a couple of incorrect alerts, and a very startled partner, I began to trust the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident! You can adjust level of sensitivity and likewise select how and when the alarm is activated (by hand, instantly or after an app message), which is reasonable.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
