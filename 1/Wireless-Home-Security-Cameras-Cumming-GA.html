<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
