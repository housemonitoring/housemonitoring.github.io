<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering convenience, assurance and complete satisfaction to every customer and are dedicated to fulfilling our customer's needs with stability, honesty, interest and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we don't believe that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
