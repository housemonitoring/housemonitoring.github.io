<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
