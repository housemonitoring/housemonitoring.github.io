With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensing units required to control your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you immediate signals. Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or email portal.
