<p>Most importantly, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of use, day and night images have always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight mice, cars and trucks, and moths.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
