<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
