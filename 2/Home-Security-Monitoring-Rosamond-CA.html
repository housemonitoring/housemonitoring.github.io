<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
