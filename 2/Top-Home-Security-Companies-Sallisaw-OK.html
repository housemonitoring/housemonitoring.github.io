<p>The primary advantage of a home security system is to secure your family, home, and prized possessions when you're away at work, on holiday, or asleep. As we've seen, there are various alternatives for equipment, monitoring, and installation at different cost points.

<p>The primary differences in between the two systems are wires and prices. The wires are apparent because it remains in the title of the two systems.
