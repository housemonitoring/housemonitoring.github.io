<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
