<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey total per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated clever home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products.
