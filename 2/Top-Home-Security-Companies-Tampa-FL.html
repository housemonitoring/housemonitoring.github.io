<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a sensational value. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is identified. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Now Wyze has actually expanded beyond security cameras with the most economical sensing units (and free app) that let you understand who's going and coming at your home.

We have actually checked KEEP and SPOT (both iSmart cameras), and we're not a fan.
