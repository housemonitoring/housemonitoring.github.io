That equipment is paid for within the first year, but do they reduce your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 monthly rate for at least another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly overpay. Besides paying too much, what if their service is poor? Too bad, you're caught in their contract.</p>
<p>Dome-style cameras are another popular option and are more streamlined and discreet than the box-style. Dome-style cameras can be utilized inside your home and outdoors and are exceptionally resilient versus both extreme weather and vandalism. The majority of security companies offer disaster home security devices, and clever versions of these gadgets can signal you on your phone when there's something going on.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.
