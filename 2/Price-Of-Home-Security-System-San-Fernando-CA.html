<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras decrease crime. Camera systems help hinder criminal offense and decrease liability by providing an objective record of events. They can be set up on the outside or interior of a structure to monitor sensitive areas such as entryways, car park, cash spaces, or secure locations of a structure. They can likewise be linked to access control systems to provide a record of who is leaving a structure and getting in.

Flood lights can discourage vandals or scare them away, however as a single tool, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
<p>Sensors: Gadget which detect invasions. Sensors may be put at the boundary of the safeguarded area, within it, or both.
