<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded cops and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and need to be teaching their clients how to appropriately set and care for their alarm systems. National and local data have actually proven that raising fines paid directly by companies and property owners have actually had no substantial influence on decreasing the variety of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have actually taken pleasure in the benefit of cops response to their consumers' alarms without any accountability for the precision or reliability of those alarms.</p>
