Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
<p>The higher the camera resolution, the sharper the images. Ideally, you'll want a 1080p or greater resolution for the very best view.
