Your system can serve as a hub for approximately 119 clever home devices, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, suggesting a more complicated setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally regarded as a more secure way to send data.</p>

Nevertheless, there are effective countermeasures (like disabling open switchports throughout switch setup and VLAN setup to limit network gain access to) that are available to protect both the information and the network it includes, but such countermeasures need to be applied uniformly to all network devices.</p>
