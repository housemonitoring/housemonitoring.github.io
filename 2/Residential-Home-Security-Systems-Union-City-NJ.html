The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
