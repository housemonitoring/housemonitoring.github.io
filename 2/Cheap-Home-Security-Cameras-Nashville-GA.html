<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
