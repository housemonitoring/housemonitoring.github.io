<h3>Best Security System in Tujunga CA</h3>
<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense.

A second alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch right away.
