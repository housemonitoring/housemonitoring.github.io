<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is an excellent security camera and a remarkable value. It gets an Excellent score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is spotted. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

Just like any criminal offense, the crooks are getting more advanced and are finding new methods to get what they desire.
