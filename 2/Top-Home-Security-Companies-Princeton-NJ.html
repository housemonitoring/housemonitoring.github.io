<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less likely to commit crime if they believe they are being seen or have a greater risk of being captured. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the offender should know the added surveillance for it to attain its desired effect.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't included a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to spend a minimum of $3 monthly if you want to save any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

With one of these, your recorded video is sent to a remote server and stored for a fixed time-- usually anywhere from 24 hours to a week-- and then deleted to make area for new videos. Though often free, these cloud plans typically need a monthly subscription, but are worth it both for their convenience and if you desire a surveillance record throughout a holiday or other extended time far from home.</p>
