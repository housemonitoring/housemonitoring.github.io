<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
