<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
