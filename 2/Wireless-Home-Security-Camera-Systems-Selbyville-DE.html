<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level.

If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>

<p>During the night, though it lacks the complete IR LED array of some rivals, the Arlo records enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the fantastic motion detection.
