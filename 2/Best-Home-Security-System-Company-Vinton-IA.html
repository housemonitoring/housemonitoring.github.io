Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices.

And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds costly, however it's not so much when you consider that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.
