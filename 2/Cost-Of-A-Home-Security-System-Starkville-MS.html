<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
<p>Cloud recording: Numerous producers provide cloud storage plans with their camera. With among these, your tape-recorded video is sent out to a remote server and stored for a predetermined time-- normally anywhere from 24 hours to a week-- and after that deleted to make space for new videos. Though sometimes free, these cloud plans typically need a regular monthly subscription, but are worth it both for their benefit and if you desire a surveillance record throughout a vacation or other prolonged time far from home.</p>
