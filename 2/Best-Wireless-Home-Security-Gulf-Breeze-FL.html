When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
