<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
