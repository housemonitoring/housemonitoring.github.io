<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
