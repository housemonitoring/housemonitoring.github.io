The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the upfront cost of the control panel, activation costs, monitoring charges and all equipment.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

Considered that, its benefits - avoiding at most a couple of street crimes, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
