<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Purchasing a wireless security system for your home is going to be a financial investment at first. Some systems also provide or require an expert monitoring service for an extra month-to-month fee. They might make a time-limited deal, and claim that you require to act now. For example, they may try to get you to sign a contract by telling you that the equipment is "totally free." More than likely, strings are connected. For example, to get your "free" alarm, you may have to sign a costly and long-lasting system monitoring contract.</p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to purchasing surveillance camera systems versus acquiring one camera at a time, especially if you're a growing business or have a big amount of residential or commercial property to cover.

<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security option (although we liked it as an animal webcam ). It has since been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration options. We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with person detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>Maybe you have children and need to add cameras to the nursery. As your children grow, it's simple to construct out your system by adding cameras in any areas where your kids require monitoring.

Disaster protection - you can link a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide gas alarm to the app. Drawback: some systems have a high rate of false alarms due to the fact that a few of these sensors may be too sensitive.
