These days, there's a lot to think of when putting together a video surveillance system. And the very first concern on most people's minds is Do I choose traditional analog cameras, or IP network cameras?" There are pros and cons to both choices. Let's focus our attention on analog CCTV surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are believed to be most effective, which normally consists of extremely populated towns, city centers, car parks, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the placement of these cameras is extremely important, the crime patterns in areas of interest are usually studied for amount of times to determine crime hotspots where cameras might possibly be put.
