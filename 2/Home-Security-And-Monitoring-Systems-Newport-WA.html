<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer care. The majority of users are not very happy with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms due to the fact that they can frequently result in service charges. Additionally, the general opinion is that the company's customer service is not extremely practical when it concerns repeating and fixing problems usage issues.

This isn't the most inexpensive SimpliSafe plan, but we believe the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth spending for.</p>
