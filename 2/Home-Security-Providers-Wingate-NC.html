<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
