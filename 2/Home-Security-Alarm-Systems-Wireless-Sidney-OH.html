When trying to find the ideal security camera, do you desire your camera to be expertly monitored or would you rather monitor it on your own? There are some companies that provide video alarm verification, like ADT, Vivint, SimpliSafe, and Bay Alarm For these companies, you'll need to opt into an expert monitoring with them in order to have your camera monitored.
