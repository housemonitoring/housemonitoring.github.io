<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
