<p>The only real issue we have is with the cost. The bundle isn't at all cheap in the very first place, however if you wish to save 4K recordings in the cloud you'll need a higher-tier additional subscription.

If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range concerns.</p>
