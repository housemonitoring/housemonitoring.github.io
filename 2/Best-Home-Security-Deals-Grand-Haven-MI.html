<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stick out too much. Pretty simple to install.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking time off from work. Employing a service technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the job and don't mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
