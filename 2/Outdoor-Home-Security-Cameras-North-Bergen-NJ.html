<p>One category where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer support. Many users are not very delighted with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms because they can regularly result in service charges. Furthermore, the general opinion is that the company's client service is not really helpful when it comes to repeating and repairing problems use problems. Setting up the Arlo Pro 2 is a faff, involving a white box that links to your router via an ethernet cable. Nevertheless, surpass that fiddly start and you discover this is a quite good home security camera.</p>
