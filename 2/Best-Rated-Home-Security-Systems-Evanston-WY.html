<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it enables you to manage almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
