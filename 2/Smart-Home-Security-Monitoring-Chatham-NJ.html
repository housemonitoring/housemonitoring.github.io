Guidelines are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are recorded, under what conditions, and how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government companies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be verified and enforced; and what punishments would apply to violators.</p>
