<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
