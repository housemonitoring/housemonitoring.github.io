Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
