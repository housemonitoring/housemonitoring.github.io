That normally means you can register for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel at any time - without early termination charges or other hidden charges. Aspects we thought about included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be included, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be included into an existing clever home setup, consisting of with voice commands by means of Amazon Alexa.</p>
