(You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren. Also like the camera, it needs an Arlo Smart subscription to store video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.
