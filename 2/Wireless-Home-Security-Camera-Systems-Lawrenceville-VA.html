<p>Home security need to never be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside or outdoors. While we always encourage main station service, some security system owners do not require or desire a central station involved.

Take a look at the ceiling of consumer electronics stores and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the average customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>

<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
