<p>All individuals with alarm systems protecting a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm license. The integration of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional details that may never ever have actually been possible previously, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, going into the building. An image of that employee is presented on screen for verification (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
