<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less likely to dedicate crime if they believe they are being seen or have a higher threat of being captured. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
