<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out mobile phone informs with that details when they appear at your home.
