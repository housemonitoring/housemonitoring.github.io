<p>The huge difference between wired and wireless systems is how signals are received. While wired systems depend on radio frequency, wireless security utilizes cellular signals.

<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we loved it as an animal camera ). It has actually since been enhanced and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
