If you currently have a security gadget from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it probably will not deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>

In long-lasting screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
