In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have actually discovered that they have actually not minimized criminal offense. "Once the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to appraise the basic downward trend in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were noted in specific categories but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal activity overall in the city centre."
