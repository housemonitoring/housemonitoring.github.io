<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out notifies, ensure it works with other smart devices.

For instance, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp indoors or activate an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
<p>Indoor cameras can be part of a total home security system or utilized on their own to add extra protection to your home and your liked ones.
