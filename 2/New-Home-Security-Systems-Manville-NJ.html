Wired Security Systems: Low-voltage wires are utilized to connect the system around your home. To make sure these are as discreet as possible, installation is typically performed by an alarm company, however, some DIY options are available.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, work with the IP cameras only from specific manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you should initially ensure that the gadget will work with the cameras you have actually acquired. The cameras must be able to provide you with the necessary information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
