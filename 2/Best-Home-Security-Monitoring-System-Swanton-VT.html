<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet camera ). It has because been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination options. We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
