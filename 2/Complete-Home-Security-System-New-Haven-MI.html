<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in many cases, less incorrect signals. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you will not need to worry about it recording or sending an alert every time the canine strolls by.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The pitch is pretty comparable across the board.

As for the month-to-month charge for professional monitoring, those are compulsory, and will typically vary from $30 to $50 monthly.</p>
