<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
