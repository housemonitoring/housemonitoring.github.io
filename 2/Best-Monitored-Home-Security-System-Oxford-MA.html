However, after nearly two years of use, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.

The Fortress Security Store Home Security System includes a built-in and a remote wireless siren with adjustable volume. While this camera records video without problems, there's an obvious lag when you stream live video. Sadly, the user handbook is hard to follow, and installing the Amcrest 4MP UltraHD on the wall limits the camera's rotation alternatives.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
