Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a really large area, and you can dim them through its app if you desire state of mind lighting on your deck or patio for a celebration. Moreover they can not send fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are continuously helping clients change.
