<p>Vivint is a monitored and professionally-installed home security system with a home automation platform. This company is called among the pioneers of home automation technology on the market today. It brings the greatest cost of the companies we have actually examined, however it provides best-in-class wise home and home automation features. This equipment for this professionally-installed system is simple, smooth, and easy-to-use. Among our preferred security services from Ring is its Neighbors app. The app is complimentary to everybody (you do not need to own a Ring item) and it works like a modern neighborhood watch where users and police can post crime watch updates and video clips of suspicious activities.</p>

Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the very best features on the marketplace, consisting of video analytics and 4K image sensors (in addition to more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative smart home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
