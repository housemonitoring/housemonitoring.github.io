<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
