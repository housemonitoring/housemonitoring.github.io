<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
