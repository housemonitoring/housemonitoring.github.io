Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

This suggests they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and objects to appear burnt out" and without any information. So much for attempting to recognize the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear correctly exposed and in full information. It has actually limited usefulness if a camera can not catch and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and at night.</p>
