<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's restroom.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>Like any invasive technology, the advantages of deploying public camera must be stabilized against the costs and risks.
