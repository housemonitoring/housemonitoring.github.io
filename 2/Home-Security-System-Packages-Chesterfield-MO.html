Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.

The video footage works as an enhance to - however not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
