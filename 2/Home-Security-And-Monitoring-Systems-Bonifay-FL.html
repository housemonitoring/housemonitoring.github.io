<p>Bullet cameras are one of the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinct look. This look is recognizable to almost everyone and therefore serves as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and crooks go somewhere else rather.

This is likewise called the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to upset can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from crime commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender should understand the included surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
