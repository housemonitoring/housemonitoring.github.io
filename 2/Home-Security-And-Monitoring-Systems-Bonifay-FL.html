In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level.

<p>Bullet cameras are one of the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinct look. This look is recognizable to almost everyone and therefore serves as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and crooks go somewhere else rather. That being stated, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism due to the fact that of their apparent look. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs multiple cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential wrongdoers are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is likewise called the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to upset can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from crime commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender should understand the included surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
