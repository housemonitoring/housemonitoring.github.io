<p>All persons with alarm systems safeguarding a facility in the City of Fredericksburg should have a legitimate alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses extra information that may never have actually been possible previously, such as alert of a staff member, by name and recognition number, entering the structure.
