<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful attacker, given that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transmitted. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the malicious assaulter to record these codes and utilize different breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
