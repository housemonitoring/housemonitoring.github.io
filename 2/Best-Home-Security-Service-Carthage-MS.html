Despite the fact that it does not have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>

Just a couple years back, the home security market was dominated by a couple of big names using expensive, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts.
