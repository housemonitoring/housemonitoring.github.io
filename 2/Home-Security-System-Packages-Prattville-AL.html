<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you have to spend a minimum of $3 per month if you want to save any videos. And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, need to provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly cost ).

That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during important security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest one of our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on family and animals-- or roaming felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
