<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
