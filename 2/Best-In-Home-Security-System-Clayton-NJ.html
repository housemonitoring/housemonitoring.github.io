<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors sometimes) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company. The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, window and door sensing units, and motion sensing units, to spot an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, connecting with you and alerting the authorities.</p>

A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch right away.
