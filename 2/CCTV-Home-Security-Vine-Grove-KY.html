<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>

<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio.
