<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 services, universities, and federal government centers, and residential clients. Some alarm systems serve a single function of robbery protection; mix systems supply both fire and intrusion protection.

Authorized personnel can bypass the requirement to request a release of the lock by use of a key electronic push-button, card gain access to device, or biometric innovation.</p>

<p>Primarily, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of day, night and usage images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and cars and trucks.</p>
