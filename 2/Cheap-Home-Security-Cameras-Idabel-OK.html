<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are typically bad night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it requires a light to brighten the location below it.

This means they usually over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing people and items to appear blown out" and with no information. So much for attempting to identify the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
