Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
