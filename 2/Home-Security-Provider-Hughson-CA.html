<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
