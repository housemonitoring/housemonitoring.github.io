<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that allows more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is permitted to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image look fuzzy.
