<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and requiring time off from work. Contacting a technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the job and don't mind investing the extra money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>

It can also inform you to something happening out of the camera's field of vision.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve.
