<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If catching footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>A societal consensus about how cameras need to be used is very important, however in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution offers some protection versus video searches performed by the police, there are presently no general, lawfully enforceable rules to limit personal privacy invasions and safeguard against abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are required to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be verified and enforced; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>
