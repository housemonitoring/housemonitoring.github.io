<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion.
