<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

Without taking the appropriate security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home open up to trespassers who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors getting their existence.</p>
