<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole household will enjoy. It's a cool trick, and one that works pretty well, however only when you have actually set up the rest of the settings. I've got a big pet dog, so needed to define the areas for the camera to detect i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet dog will be strolling. After a few incorrect alerts, and a very startled spouse, I started to trust the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident!
