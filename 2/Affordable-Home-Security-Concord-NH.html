<p>All of the self-installed systems I tested can operate without a monitoring strategy, but then they are restricted to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and in some cases, pushing a notification to your phone and do not have the ability to immediately dispatch authorities or emergency personnel. Because phone batteries pass away and cellular service differs depending upon where you are, a push notification is typically a poor approach of triaging when your home security system has actually been tripped.</p>
