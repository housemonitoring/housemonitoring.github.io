<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
