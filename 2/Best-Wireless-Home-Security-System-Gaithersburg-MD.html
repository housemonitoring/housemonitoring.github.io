<p>Most security cameras can be utilized both indoors and outdoors. They typically have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in durability. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most resilient. Since their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices. In terms of detection, it is much better to have actually a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection.
