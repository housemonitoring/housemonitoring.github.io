<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole household will love.

After a few incorrect signals, and an extremely startled other half, I started to trust the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident!

Be absolutely sure you can manage it if you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages.
