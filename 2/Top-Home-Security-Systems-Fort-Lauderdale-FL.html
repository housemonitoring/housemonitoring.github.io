<p>Clear night vision is one of the most important features for outdoor security cameras. To get the very best and brightest night view, consider a camera with infrared (IR) technology to sending out bright light through wavelengths. The variety of infrared LEDs used in a camera identifies how far your outdoor security camera will be able to clearly reveal what's outside your home.

Many designs also have an integrated IR cut-switch that immediately enables and disables the infrared technology depending on the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic clever home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for potential plan burglars or speak to visitors who stop by.</p>
