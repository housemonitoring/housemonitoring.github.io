Uninstalling, re-installing a system and moving is particularly problematic and normally inadvisable, because it suggests putting old hardware in a new location.</p>
<p>When portability and movement are important to homeowners, wireless systems have a guaranteed benefit, since they can be removed easily and reinstalled quickly.
