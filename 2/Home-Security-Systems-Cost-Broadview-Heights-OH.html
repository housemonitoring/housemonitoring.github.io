<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
