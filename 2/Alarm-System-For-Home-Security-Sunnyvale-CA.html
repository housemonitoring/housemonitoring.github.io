<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover a whole room when put inside your home. It will cover a 5-tile radius if put on an outside wall.

Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur.

<p>Wireless security cameras being tested in a Consumer Reports laboratory. You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB.
