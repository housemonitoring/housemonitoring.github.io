Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by.
