Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.
