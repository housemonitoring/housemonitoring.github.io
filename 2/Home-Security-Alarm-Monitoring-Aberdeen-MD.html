Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
