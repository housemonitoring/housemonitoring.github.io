<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you intend to keep and for how long you plan to keep documented footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

Guidelines are required to develop a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be verified and imposed; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>
