<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.
