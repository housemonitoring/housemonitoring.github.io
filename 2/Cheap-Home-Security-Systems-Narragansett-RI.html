<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't afford the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic plan. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
