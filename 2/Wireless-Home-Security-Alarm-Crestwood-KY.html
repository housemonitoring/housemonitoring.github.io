<h3>Motion Detector Alarm Crestwood KY 40014</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
