Conspicuously put cameras have been proven to reduce risks of violence and vandalism at companies dramatically.</p>
<p>Capable of operating in both regular and inadequately lit environments, these cameras benefit from not needing inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional sensitive imaging chips.
